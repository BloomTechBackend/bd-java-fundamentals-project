# Text Adventure Project

Welcome to the Text Adventure Project! This is for Unit 1 of the Backend Development course and is intended to ensure that you have a good handle on the Java fundamentals that you'll need for future units. You will use this same project throughout Unit 1, building on what you previously have built. You can find instructions for each assignment by going to the `Instructions` folder. You will be graded on your code's ability can successfully pass each test and your code's organization (based on a lint checker).

To run tests, you can do this inside of IntelliJ by opening the desired test file and clicking on the run icon to the left of the code.

You can also run tests in your terminal by running the following:

```
./gradlew test --tests com.adventure.sprint<sprint_number>.S<sprint_number>M<module_number>Test
./gradlew test --tests com.adventure.sprint1.S1M2Test
```

To run the lint checker, you can do so in your terminal by running the following:

```
./gradlew checkstylemain 
```

If you have any infractions, you'll find a file link in your terminal that you can copy and paste into your browser for more details.
