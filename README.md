# Text Adventure Project

Welcome to the Text Adventure Project! This is for Unit 1 of the Backend Development course and is intended to ensure that you have a good handle on the Java fundamentals that you'll need for future units. 

You can find instructions for each assignment by going to the `Instructions` folder within this project. These instructions will also be in Canvas. You will be graded on your code's ability can successfully pass each test and your code's readability (based on a lint checker). As you work on your assignment, it will be most helpful for you to run the tests and lint checker regularly to make sure you're on track.

To run tests, you can do this inside of IntelliJ by opening the desired test file and clicking on the run icon to the left of the code.

You can also run tests in your terminal. Here's an example test command:

```
./gradlew test --tests com.adventure.sprint1.S1M2Test
```

To run the lint checker (verifies that your coding **style** follows best practice), you can do so in your terminal by running the following:

```
./gradlew checkstylemain 
```

If you have any infractions after running the lint checker, you'll find a file link in your terminal that you can copy and paste into your browser for more details.

### Issues

If you find any issues with the codebase, please feel free to reach out to me and we can get it resolved. 

Best of luck!
